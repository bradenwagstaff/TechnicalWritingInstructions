## Description

## Steps

### Terminal
    
Learn to navigate the terminal.
Main commands:  
`cd` - change directory  
`pwd` - print working directory  
`ls` - list files  
`mkdir` - create directory  
`touch` - create file  
`code .` - open VSCode in the current directory

Start with open terminal

run `cd` to go to the home directory  

run `ls` to list all files in that directory  

pick one of the folders and run `cd folder_name` to go into that folder 

For example if `Desktop` is a folder I would run `cd Desktop`  

To create a folder run `mkdir folder_name`  

For example if I wanted to create a folder called `test` I would run `mkdir test`  

Navigate to that folder by running `cd test`  

You should now be in the `test` folder   

Create a file called `test.txt` by running `touch test.txt`  

Run `ls` to see the file you just created   

To move backwards a directory run `cd ..`  

You should now be in the folder you were in before you navigated to the `test` folder  


You now know how to navigate throughouy the terminal.

Navigate back to the home directory by running `cd`  

Create a folder called `instruction_project` by running `mkdir instruction_project`  

Navigate to that folder by running `cd instruction_project`  

Create a file called `test.py` by running `touch test.py`  

We're going to open this directory in VSCode by running `code .`
